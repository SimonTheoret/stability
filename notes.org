** Experiments
1. [ ] Train VAE model on CIFAR10 data.
2. [ ] Save model and optimizer checkpoint as original
3. [ ] Generate 10K examples
4. [ ] Compute FID, precision and recall for the current model
5. [ ] For N iterations, do :
   1. [ ] synth = Generate \lambda*|Train set| new images.
   2. [ ] Train on (training set \Union synt) 
   3. [ ] Compute FID, precision and recall for the current model
